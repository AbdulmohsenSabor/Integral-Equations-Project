# Integral-Equations-Project
This is a 70-page project submitted as part of the MATH 625: Integral Equations course during my Master’s degree in Mathematics at Taibah University. The project, worth 10 marks, presents a detailed study of the Variational Iteration Method (VIM) and its application to a variety of integral and integro-differential equations. It includes worked examples for Volterra and Fredholm equations, both linear and nonlinear, as well as systems of equations. The project also covers transforming first-kind Volterra equations into second-kind using Leibniz’s rule and demonstrates convergence to exact solutions like eˣ, sinh(x), and cos(x).
